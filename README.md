# COV and Good News

**Cov and Good News** is a web application (built and submitted to IvyHacks) that allows users to see the current statistics of COVID-19 in the world as well as in individual countries, as well as provides a list of good news regarding COVID-19. The statistics and the list of good news are displayed side-by-side on the page as to show users that no matter how the COVID situation may look like, there are still good happening in the world.The statistics is obtained using the API `https://covid19.mathdro.id/`, while the list of good news is the list of search result as displayed by Google at the time of the user's visit.

## Motivation and Aim
The motivation behind this project is that the news topics being dominated by the pandemic makes it hard for people to stay positive. This also has a major effect on people's mental health. I personally have tried to stay away from the news, but found it difficult to do because I still wanted to know the situations in countries such as Indonesia, India, UK, Nepal, etc. where my family and friends are living. *Cov and Good News* allows users stay informed about the current status of COVID-19, but also encourages users to hold out hope because there are developments being made in regards to COVID-19 and there are still good things happening in this world. The aim is to hopefully help people stay informed while also avoiding being anxious by providing a list of good news.

## Direction to run the application
The web application is built using Flask. First install all the requirements in the `requirements.txt` file. Then run the `app.py` file.

### Notes:
`funcs.py` contains helper functions. `static` contains CSS files. `templates` contains HTML templates.
